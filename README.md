# Neural Networks

This my neural network implementation from Computer Science III.

## About

In this project, neural networks are used to train an AI to accurately identify handwritten digits from the MNIST database of handwritten digits. In my trials, my model was able to achieve 97.5% training accuracy and 97.28% testing accuracy.
